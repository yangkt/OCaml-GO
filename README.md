## Overview
Go is an ancient Chinese strategy board game for two players and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played today. The aim of the game is to surround more territory than your opponent. The rules of the game are relatively simple, but the game itself is very complex. The lower bound on the legal number of board positions in Go has been estimated to be 2 × 10170. Thus, ”Go” was considered to be impossible to solve computationally until the advent of AlphaGo, the AI developed by Google’s Deepmind that defeated the Go world champion, Lee Sedol, in March 2016.
