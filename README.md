## Overview
Go is an ancient Chinese strategy board game for two players and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played today. The aim of the game is to surround more territory than your opponent. The rules of the game are relatively simple, but the game itself is very complex. The lower bound on the legal number of board positions in Go has been estimated to be 2 × 10170. Thus, ”Go” was considered to be impossible to solve computationally until the advent of AlphaGo, the AI developed by Google’s Deepmind that defeated the Go world champion, Lee Sedol, in March 2016. 

## Installation
Our game uses the OCamL Graphics and ANSITerminal Modules.  In order to play our game, these modules must be intalled on your computer. 


## To Play 
Our game offers two types of gameplay
1. Text based: `make text`
2. Gui based: `make gui` 
  
In each version of gameplay, there is the option to play as two players, one player vs an easy ai, and one player vs a hard ai.  These options will be presented at the start of the game.  In addition, the option to place handicap stones is also given at the start of the game.  There are a few ways to end the game, either through one player surrendering, both players passing consecutively, or quiting the game interface. 


## Instructions
### Text Based Game Play:
Upon starting, the game will ask a series of questions for board initiation.  One the game begins, a series of instructions that include the possible text commands will be given.
### GUI Based Game Play:
Upon starting, the GUI will have several different options presented to the user as buttons on the screen.  Continue to make your selections until you reach the game.  Game play works by either clicking the screen to place a stone on the board, or by clicking one of the buttons.
